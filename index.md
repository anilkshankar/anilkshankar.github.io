Hi there! Welcome to my tiny corner. Here's a little about me. 

I am a _quantitative user experience researcher_ who is equally comfortable in _qualitative_ research; in today's keyword-happy paralance, I'm comfortable with _mixed-methods_ research, or just __research__. I'm less interested in the ephemeral subjective labels used for research methods and more keen on __solving__ human-computer interaciton (HCI) challenges for customers to improve their lives while ensuring that these challenges also have a business significance (for my employers). 

### Work Experience
## Senior (Quantitative) UX Researcher, Microsoft, Redmond, WA
### May 2018 to present
* Quantitative research to empower AI and ML teams [responsibly](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/our-approach-to-ai) ship products based on our principles of inclusiveness, fairness, transparency, reliability, privacy and security
* Quantitative UX research for [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise) via behavioral (Telemetry) and attitudinal (NPS/SAT scores) customer data to prioritize features in two core areas: Collaboration experiences and Licensing, Billing, Renewals. 
  * My research approaches include KANO, Conjoint Analysis, Max-Diff, A/B testing, and multivariate statistical analyses. 
  *  With these approaches, I help Product and Design teams prioritize customer requested features and to track improvements in UX. 
* I also guide qualitative researchers transform their user data (sentimental feedback, surveys, etc.) into quantifiable insights with statistical approaches using chi-square tests, t-tests, and ANOVA. 

## Senior UX Manager: Research & Design, Docker, San Francisco, CA 	 
### July 2017 to May 2018 
* I led user research to prove that there was no statistically significant difference for the efficiency of core task flows for Docker’s Command-Line Interface (CLI) and GUI in 2017. 
  * These insights helped Product and Design leaders better invest resources towards features and to handle technical debt that mattered the most to our customers. 
* As the startup went through a massive leadership change, I also managed Docker’s research and design teams to continue to progress work on two core enterprise products: Universal Control Plane (UCP), Docker Trusted Registry (DTR).

## UX Manager: Research & Design, Cloudera, Palo Alto, CA 
### Nov 2015 to July 2017
* My first major contribution was to help C-level/Senior leadership in Product and Engineering gain insights into customers adoption of [Cloudera Manager](https://www.cloudera.com/products/product-components/cloudera-manager.html) (CM) which is a single pane of glass to manage all Hadoop resources. 
  * This research was conducted with a large-scale survey that focused on key (financially relevant) customers across single and multiple tenants. 
  * The survey design was informed with data from a combination of multiple resources: CM customer behavior insights gained via user interviews, product telemetry, marketing and sales data stores. 
  * Results from this research helped Product and Engineering better focus in improving the UX for Upgrades, Backup and Disaster Recovery workflows. 
* My second major contribution was to lead research to help a $19.6M [acquisition](https://optimizer.cloudera.com/) (query optimizer offering) improve their product usage funnel from 20 percent to 75 percent via informed telemetry analysis to identify key bottlenecks and then address these UX issues with newer designs that were A/B tested. 
* As a manager, I also hired researchers, designers, and established UX presence to emphasize customer voice with evidence-based approaches for design improvements; my team designed and supported end-to-end workflows for six key Cloudera products as we optimized for our IPO.

## Lead User Experience Researcher, Platfora, San Mateo, CA (acquired by Workday)    
### Nov 2013 to Nov 2015
* To improve the UX for the first data visualization and analytics platform on Hadoop, [Prism Analytics](https://www.workday.com/en-us/applications/prism-analytics.html) I established a quantitative framework to leverage product telemetry, surveys, remote usability studies, and A/B tests. 
* One of my key contributions here was to track the adoption of core workflows to build data-driven personas via hierarchical clustering (mixed models) by leveraging a large dataset filtered to 2400 key customers. 
  * I published this novel work at ACM’s CHI in 2015. 
* I mentored two UX designers and managed two UX researchers and three summer interns on the team. 
* I published three refereed articles at ACM CHI based on user research projects in 2014 and 2015. 

## Senior User Experience Researcher, RightScale Inc, Santa Barbara, CA (acquired by Flexera Inc)                 
### Nov 2012 to Nov 2013
* For this cloud management platform that serves AWS, GCE, and Azure, I conducted research to optimize DevOps workflows via surveys, remote usability studies, A/B tests, and telemetry analyses. 
* A key contribution of my research was the optimization of interaction design (task times reduced by 15 percent) for managing deployments across multiple cloud service providers.

## Senior Computer Scientist, Starkey Hearing Research Center, Berkeley, CA 	
### Jan 2008 to Nov 2012
* As the first HCI researcher, I conducted foundational comparative usability studies to improve product design. 
  * This research helped Starkey improve the transition workflow challenges faced by audiologists who use/sell hearing-aid fitting software from multiple vendors. 
* With another research initiative, I leveraged _Mechanical Turk_ to crowd-source audio-tags (labels for semi-supervised learning) to help hearing-scientists quickly train their algorithms for diverse acoustic environments. 
  * This novel research reduced the time for label collection, increased inter-rater reliability, and reduced the time for launching these algorithms with hearing-aid prototypes. 
* In another project, I collaborated with hearing-scientists and engineers to guide the design and evaluation of the first self-fitting tool for hearing-aids, [SoundPoint](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/starkey-soundpoint/id405249175). My research leveraged approaches ranging from lab usability studies, cognitive walkthroughs, Wizard-of-Oz techniques, and Brain-Computer Interfaces. 
  * A key contribution of this research was improved user experience (measured via Task Times, Hearing-Comfort scale, and SUS scores) for end-users ranging in age from 6 years to 70 years (including motor impairments).
 
## Research Assistant, Evolutionary Computing Systems Lab, University of Nevada
### Reno, NV 2002-2008
I built a machine-learning framework, [__Sycophant__](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8e4qoywoecx8oky/Sycophant_PhD.pdf?dl=0) with core Python and the Weka machine learning framework to personalize desktop applications. To reduce interruptions, my research harnessed both internal and external contextual information from a user’s environment to predict her preferred application actions.
