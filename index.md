Hi there! Welcome to my tiny corner. Here's a little about me. 

### I am a quantitative user experience researcher who is also well-versed in qualitative research; in the keyword-happy (or lazy) paralance, I'm comfortable with mixed-methods research, or just research. More than these pseudo-dichotmies of methods or techniques, I am keen on solving human-computer interaciton (HCI) challenges for customers to improve their lives...while ensuring that these challenges also have a business significance (for my employers). 

### Work Experience
## Senior (Quantitative) UX Researcher, Microsoft, Redmond, WA
### May 2018 to present
* Quantitative UX research for Microsoft 365 Admin Center via behavioral (Telemetry) and attitudinal (NPS/SAT scores) customer data to prioritize features in two core areas: Collaboration experiences and Licensing, Billing, Renewals. 
* My research approaches include KANO, Conjoint Analysis, Max-Diff, A/B testing, and multivariate statistical analyses. 
* With these approaches, I help Product and Design teams prioritize customer requested features and to track improvements in UX. 
* I also guide qualitative researchers transform their user data (sentimental feedback, surveys, etc.) into quantifiable insights with statistical approaches using chi-square tests, t-tests, and ANOVA. 

## Senior UX Manager: Research & Design, Docker, San Francisco, CA 	 
## July 2017 to May 2018 
* I led user research to prove that there was no statistically significant difference for the efficiency of core task flows for Docker’s Command-Line Interface (CLI) and GUI in 2017. 
* These insights helped Product and Design leaders better invest resources towards features and to handle technical debt that mattered the most to our customers. 
* As the startup went through a massive leadership change, I also managed Docker’s research and design teams to continue to progress work on two core enterprise products: Universal Control Plane (UCP), Docker Trusted Registry (DTR).
